--1)Show the city with the highest crime gravity for each state.

select [Measures].[Crime Gravity] on columns,
nonempty(generate([Geography].[State].[State], 
topcount(
([Geography].[State].currentmember, [Geography].[City State].[City State]),
1,
[Measures].[Crime Gravity])), [Measures].[Crime Gravity]) on rows
from [Group ID 14 DB]



--2)For each state, show the incident with the highest ratio between his total crime gravity and the average crime gravity of that state.

with member crime_average as avg([Incident].[Incident Id].[Incident Id], [Measures].[Crime Gravity])
	member ratio as [Measures].[Crime Gravity]/crime_average
select ratio on columns,
nonempty(generate([Geography].[State].[State], 
topcount(
([Geography].[State].currentmember,
[Incident].[Incident Id].[Incident Id]),
1,
[Measures].[Crime Gravity]))) on rows
from [Group ID 14 DB]





--3)For each city, show the difference between each quarter’s total crime gravity and the previous quarter’s total crime gravity.

with member diff_prev as
([Date].[TIME_hierarchy].currentmember, [Measures].[Crime Gravity])-
([Date].[TIME_hierarchy].prevmember, [Measures].[Crime Gravity])

select {[Measures].[Crime Gravity], diff_prev} on columns,
nonempty((
      [Geography].[City State].[City State],
	  [Date].[Year].[Year], --for a better understanding in the results (quarter 1 and 2 are related only if they are from the same year)
      [Date].[TIME_hierarchy].[Quarter]
    )) on rows
