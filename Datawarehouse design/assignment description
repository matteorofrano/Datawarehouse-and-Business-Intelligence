Police.csv contains the main body of data: a table with data about gun violence incidents
between January 2013 and March 2018 in the US. The same table also includes information
about the victims, the guns, and the locations. The file dates.xml maps each date id from
the Police.csv file to a real date.
Finally, the files partecipant age.json (F1), partecipant type.json (F2), and partecipant status.json (F3) are three dictionaries containing the data necessary to compute
the crime gravity attribute.
The following assignments aim to build and deploy the schema on server lds.di.unipi.it.
In the provided data are present missing values, useless information, and has been needed
